## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

### ⚠️ Three Critical Privacy Crises in Solana DeFi:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

#### 🔍 **Wallets Are Tracked**
- Solana's transparent ledger exposes identity and transaction history
- Every SPL token transfer is tracked and potentially reported
- PnL and strategies are visible to competitors
- Successful strategies are immediately copied

</td>
<td width="33%">

#### 🤖 **Execution Becomes Predictable**
- Order intent leaks before confirmation on Solana DEXs
- Bots pre-position against large orders using program logs
- Visible flow widens quotes and worsens fills
- Settlement windows invite MEV extraction

</td>
<td width="33%">

#### 💰 **Privacy Forces Liquidity Trade-offs**
- Private venues on Solana are underfunded with size limits
- Moving between privacy islands is slow and costly
- Users must choose: privacy or best price
- Institutions cannot operate at scale without confidentiality

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 📊 Solana Market Impact:
- **$2.1B** extracted in 2024 via MEV on Solana
- **$45M** lost monthly to front-running on Solana DEXs
- **67%** of Solana traders cite privacy as a key barrier to institutional adoption

> **This is not autonomy. It is transparency as a tool of control.**
